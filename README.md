# UCL-HDS-Dissertation
A University College London MSc Health Data Science Dissertation and AstraZeneca Summer Studentship Project

Project: Human-like AI Analysis on Pathologic Images

Dataset Used: https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/

## Objectives
- To explore the effects of human-like image transformation including magnification and colour space on the performance of AI and ML analysis of pathologic whole slide images (WSI)
- To design a computationally efficient ML model for WSI analysis combining various ML techniques
- To create reusable assets for pathologic image analysis and discuss implications on study results
